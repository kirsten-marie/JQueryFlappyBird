This is a basic flappy bird game I created based on a helpful tutorial to complete for school. It is just the bare bones. Once I am done with this semester, I want to go back and make the bird animated using a sprite sheet, to make a better starting & ending page, and to animate the background. I just ran out of time for now. 

Thanks for the awesome tutorial found here to get this going: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrzr-QBVNNM
